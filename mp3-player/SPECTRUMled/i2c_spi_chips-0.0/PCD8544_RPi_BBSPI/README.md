Raspberry Pi PCD8544 Library
============================
A simple PCD8544 LCD (Nokia3310/5110) driver. Target board is Raspberry Pi.
This driver uses 5 GPIOs on target board with a bit-bang SPI implementation (hence, may not be as fast but seems fast enough).
Makes use of WiringPI-library of _Gordon Henderson_ (https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/)
